## Implementations

Jimmy has been implemented on 4 platforms:

- Xilinx's Vivado:
  - Simulated in a Verilog test bench.
  - Running on a BASYS3 board (by Digilent), with an Artix-7 FPGA. 

- Intel's Quartus Prime: 
  - Simulated in a Verilog test bench.
  - Running on the DE0-CV board (by Terasic), with a Cyclone-V FPGA.

- Doulos' EDA Playground: 
  - Simulated on the Icarus Verilog simulator.

- LabsLand.com, a remote-lab website: 
  - Running on a variety of FPGA boards around the world.
